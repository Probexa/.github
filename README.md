# 🚀 Probexa — Official Launch README

Probexa is a **decentralized AI-powered prediction market** built natively on **Solana**, focused exclusively on **early-stage meme tokens** (market cap < $10M). It combines **prediction markets, meme discovery, AI-generated odds, and zero-knowledge verification (ZKML)** to create a transparent, private, and high-signal platform for speculative crypto intelligence.

---

## 🌐 What is Probexa?

Probexa enables users to create and participate in prediction markets around **emerging meme tokens** before they reach mainstream attention.

Unlike generic platforms such as Polymarket, Probexa is:

* 🎯 **Niche-focused** — only meme tokens under $10M market cap
* ⚡ **Fast & cheap** — powered by Solana
* 🤖 **AI-driven** — odds generated using real-time data & sentiment
* 🔐 **Privacy-first** — bets remain private, outcomes verifiable via ZK proofs
* 🧠 **Community-curated** — markets approved through DAO governance

Example markets:

* *Will this meme token reach $50M market cap by Q2 2026?*
* *Will Token X pump 5× within 30 days?*

## 🧩 Core Features

### 🔍 Meme Token Discovery & Filtering

Probexa continuously scans thousands of tokens across:

* Solana
* Ethereum
* Base
* BSC

Using oracle data (Chainlink, Pyth, DexScreener), AI filters tokens based on:

* Market cap < $10M
* Liquidity depth
* Social momentum (X / Telegram / Reddit)
* Holder distribution
* Virality signals

Only the **top 100–200 tokens** are surfaced.

**Meme Radar** dashboard provides:

* AI-generated summaries
* Momentum indicators
* Early-warning rug signals

> Users earn **PROB rewards** for submitting valid undiscovered tokens.

---

### 🤖 AI-Generated Odds (ZKML Verified)

Probexa uses AI models trained on historical meme token behavior to generate dynamic odds based on:

* On-chain price data
* Volume & liquidity changes
* Social sentiment analysis
* Historical pump/dump patterns

To ensure trust:

* Odds computation runs off-chain
* **Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (ZKML)** proofs verify correctness
* No model weights or user data are exposed

Supported ZK frameworks:

* RISC Zero
* Nova-based ZKML systems

Optional **AI Challenges** allow users to dispute odds and trigger re-computation.
